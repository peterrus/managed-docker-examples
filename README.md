# Managed Docker Examples

This repository is mainly intended for my own reference but might be useful for others to build upon. All examples make use of (and provision) a container registry, so custom Docker images can be used.

Currently contains examples for the following providers:
- [AWS (ECS + EC2)](aws/)

Soon:
- [Azure (AppServices)](#)
- [GCP Serverless (Cloud Run)](#)
